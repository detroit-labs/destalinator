Hey everyone! At Detroit Labs, we automatically archive channels after 90 days of quiet. This channel has been quiet for the past 60 days. If you'd like to keep this channel active, SAY ANYTHING in the next 30 days to reset the timer. Archived channels can easily be unarchived later if needed. Thanks!
